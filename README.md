This is a firefox extension that lets you open the first 9 links in the google search results with keys 1-9 on your keyboard.

### Usage
1. Search up anything on Google, such that your browser now has a `www.google.com/search` page open.
2. Press any of the number keys 1-9 to open the corresponding search result page in a new tab.

### TODO:
- Featured snippets screw it up. The `1` link becomes going back to the page itself, the featured snipped is inaccessible. The links after the snippet work fine.
- When you look up movies it also breaks, almost the same way but `1` and `2` break, and the normal links start at `3`.
- Looking up a famous person breaks it similarly to featured snippets, except `2`-`9` just open a blank tab.
